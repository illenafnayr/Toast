This is an app inspired by ffffound.com, a website where a user is recommended suggested images based on what their tastes. For this project, a random image from the database is displayed on the homepage as well as a button to generate a new image. If a user likes a particular image, they can click on it and it will bring them to another page that will show more information about the image as well as a list of similar images that show based on the tags associated with them. Each image can be liked as well, and this info is saved to the database.

This application is a C.R.U.D application built using node.js, mongodb/mongoose, and express.js. The database is a collection of users and images. If you sign up for an account you can upload images that will get displayed to the public.

This project was put together in 3 days, after abandoning an idea that was too difficult to achieve given my current tech stack. Therefore, the styling is not yet where it should be and is not responsive. I would also like to add features such as only displaying 3 similar images, instead of ALL of the images with associated tags. I would also like to add a section on the show page of other images by the user who uploaded the image. To my future self 3 days from now; these are the next steps for this project.
